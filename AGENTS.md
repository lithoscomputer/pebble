# Repository Instructions

## Project purpose

This repository is a Rust project template. Replace this section with the
project's purpose and authoritative documents after copying the repository.

## Rust style

Before changing Rust code, configuration, project structure, or tests:

1. Run `bin/style-guides prepare`.
2. Read `.ai/style-guides/rust-style-guide/SKILL.md` completely.
3. Read each workflow and policy page that the skill routes for the task.

Project requirements and accepted architecture decisions override general
style-guide defaults.

## Repository tasks

- Use `mise run dev` for the normal development path.
- Use `mise run test` for the routine test suite.
- Use `mise run check` for the complete routine verification gate.
- Use `mise run check:nightly` for the extended verification gate.
- Use `mise run fmt` to format Rust with the pinned nightly formatter.

## Safety

- Never install packages less than 24 hours old.
- Never force push, including with `--force-with-lease`.
- Never amend commits. Create a new commit instead.

## Working documents

Save plans under `.ai/plans/` and reviews under `.ai/reviews/`.
